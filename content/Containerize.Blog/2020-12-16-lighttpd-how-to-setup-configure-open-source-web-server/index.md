Welcome to another blog post in the [Web Server Solution Stack][1] category. We have published many articles such as [[Setup XAMPP and phpMyAdmin as localhost on Windows][2]][3], [Top 5 Open Source Web Server Solution Stacks In 2021][4], and some others. These articles demonstrated the setting up processes of various open source web servers along with the detailed guide articles. In fact, a webserver was introduced in the back 90s and since then it has gained utmost popularity in the digital world. There are many factors that are attached to serving content over the internet or intranet. However, a huge part of the digital industry is attached to the companies or communities that maintain web server solutions.
