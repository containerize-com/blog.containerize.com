## Overview

We recently published blog posts on [Blockchain Technology for Business][1] and a tutorial article on building a [Basic Smart Contract][2]. However, we have compiled a list of the following popular Blockchain Platforms of 2020.

  * **[Ethereum][3]** 
  * **[Hypeledger Fabric][4]**
  * **[Openchain][5]**
  * **[Multichain][6]**
  * **[Ripple][7]** 
  * **[Conclusion][8]** 

## Ethereum {#ether}

[Ethereum][9] is a leading open source Blockchain based platform. It provides a complete framework to manage digital assets, write smart contracts, and build decentralized apps. This software uses a consensus algorithm named proof of work(POW). It supports its own cryptocurrency called Ether. Moreover, Ethereum has five major components Ethereum Virtual Machine, Smart Contracts, Ethereum Nodes, Ethereum Client Apis, and End User Applications. It is written in Go language and all the source code is available at [Github][10].

Following are the prominent features:

  * Secure With Cryptography
  * Ethereum Smart Contracts
  * Blockchain Validation
  * Ethereum Virtual Machine
  * Multi-layered Architecture

## Hypeledger Fabric {#hyper}

[Hyperledger Fabric][12] is an open source permissioned blockchain built on a modular architecture. However, it gives provision to the users to use any consensus protocol depending upon the use case. Moreover, this software is scalable, robust, and efficient. It provides integration with third party software such as LDAP, OpenID Connect, and cryptographic libraries. It is also written in Go language and its source code is available on [Github][13].

Hyperledger Fabric has the following key features:

  * Support for EVM and Solidity
  * Component Based Architecture 
  * Scalable and Flexible 
  * Multi-language Smart Contract Support
  * Queryable data

## Openchain {#open}

[Openchain][15] is comparatively a new Blockchain technology and it is based on client server architecture. Further, anyone can set up an instance of this open source software and there is an administrator for each instance who validates the transactions. In addition, there is no mining mechanism supported in Openchain. Above all, the Partionned Consensus algorithm is being used in this platform. It is written in C# language and its source code is available at [Github][16].

Openchain offers the following important features:

  * Provision To Define Rules
  * Instant Level Validation
  * No Mining Fee
  * Extensible and Scalable 
  * Multiple Levels of Control

## Multichain

[Multichain][18] is another open source software that offers rapid development of Blockchain applications public and private both. Firstly, it is highly customizable, user friendly, and flexible. Secondly, it provides utmost security through public-private keys and multi signatures. Thirdly, this open source software provides easy steps to developed and deploy blockchain apps. Further, it is written in C++ language and its source code is available at [Github][19].

Multichain comes up with the following key features:

  * Support For Unlimited Assets 
  * Permissions Management 
  * Secure With Public-Private Key 
  * Flexible and Robust 
  * Real-Time Data Feeds

## Ripple {#Ripple}

[Ripple][20] is enterprise level open source Blockchain platform with advanced features. Therefore, it is based on a decentralized infrastructure that supports secured transactions of digital assets. Above all, it has a wide range of features that are enough to establish a payments business. Moreover, it is powered by an XRP ledger that is a decentralized cryptographic ledger. However, this open source software is written in C++ language with the input of other languages too and its source code is available at [Github][21].

Ripple offers the following key points:

  * Powered By XRP Ledger
  * Offers convenient Asset Transfer 
  * Provides Digital Security 
  * Business-Friendly
  * Multipurpose
