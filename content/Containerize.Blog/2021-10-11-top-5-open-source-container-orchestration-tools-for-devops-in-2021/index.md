## **Overview**

Container orchestration tools help IT administrators, software developers and users to manage containerized applications during development, testing, scaling and deployment process. These container orchestration software also facilitate to schedule and deploy multiple containers for implementation within an application, to identify failed container implementations and manage declarative configurations. **Open source container orchestration tools** help users to automate the process of running instances, provisioning hosts, and linking containers to increase scalability and functionality of applications by adding containers.

Orchestration tools help in optimizing orchestration process, improving container security by setting containers access permissions and keeping container components separated from one another. Currently, there are many cloud based open source container orchestration tools list available in the market that different organizations use for production environments to **manage containers and microservices**. Let’s review some of the top orchestration tools.

**What are container orchestration platforms?** In this article, we will get familiar with the most popular open source container orchestration frameworks for DevOps in 2021.

[Kubernetes][2] open source orchestration system is the widespread adoption of containers among organizations, also known as **kube or k8s** (8 stands for the number of letters between the “k” and the “s”). It has become the de facto standard for scheduling and automating computer applications to build, deploy, scale and manage containerized applications due to the flexible nature of kubernetes architecture. K8 kubernetes is used to manage Linux Containers across private, public and hybrid cloud environments. Kube is container-centric and focuses more on deploying and managing services.

Kubernetes starting point is the cluster itself and how willing you are to step away from the Docker way. It starts big at the kubernetes cluster and uses containers almost as an implementation detail. It makes everything associated with **deploying, load balncing and managing** your application easier by reducing the operational efforts, inspired by Google’s internal cluster management system, Borg. Kubernetes container orchestration platform was originally developed and designed by engineers at Google and Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in mid 2014. **K3s** is a CNCF sandbox project that delivers a fully compliant lightweight Kubernetes distribution. **K3s** is a purpose built container orchestrator while **K8s** orchestration is a general purpose container k8s orchestrator open source tool for running Kubernetes.

**The most popular** **tools that integrate with Orchestration Kubernetes** are Helm, Rancher, Snyk, Ansible, Docker, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EKS, Google Compute Engine, and Vagrant.

**Top companies using Kubernetes** orchestration in their tech stacks to build, manage and deploy container environment for applications are Google, Kubermatic, DigitalOcean, Shopify, Udemy, Slack, Asana, Walmart and Prometheus.

[Docker swarm][5] is a simple container orchestration tool native to docker platform for managing containerized applications. It allows developers to create, deploy, and manage a cluster of Docker nodes across multiple host machines. Docker Swarm mode allows you to manage docker engine clusters locally within the docker system. It is used to efficiently manage, scale and **deploy distributed cluster of nodes on production** with the same files as used by docker compose orchestration locally. One of the key advantages of swarm is the high level of service availability offered for applications.

Docker Swarm container orchestration starts at the container and builds out, provides an easy way to move into cloud container orchestration without knowledge of existing docker tools. Swarm is suitable for experiments and smaller scale container orchestration and deployments due to limitations of early Swarm releases and **less proven than Kubernetes and Mesos** container orchestration. Docker swarm open source consists of manager and worker nodes that run services.

**The most popular tools that integrate with Docker Swarm** are Azure Container Service, Docker for AWS, Codefresh, Flocker, Continuous Delivery Service, Docker Datacenter, Traefik and Portainer.

**Top companies using Docker Swarm** orchestration in their tech stacks are OODA, Appwrite, NET Core, DevTeam, Patients Know Best and Mainwebsolutions.
