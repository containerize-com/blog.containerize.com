## Overview

Welcome to another article in the series of [Web Server Solution Stacks][1]. In the recent past, we have published blog posts on topics such as [Setup XAMPP and phpMyAdmin as localhost on Windows][2], [How to Install Nextcloud with Apache on Ubuntu Server][3], [Setup Tutorial For LEMP Stack On Ubuntu 18.04][4] and some more. As a developer, when you decide to develop a web application, the selection of web and database servers for hosting an application is the first task. Before deploying a web app on a live server, developers must build and test the app on the local server first. There are many options for open source web server software. A good web server should have qualities like user-friendliness, stability, expandability, and scalability.

A web server is a type of software that is installed on the operating system. With the help of HTTP transfer protocols, client requests are passed on to the webs erver and in return, the web server delivers documents to requesting clients. For static content, like HMTL files or images, then the web server directly processes the request by sending the corresponding data to the client. Dynamic content, on the other hand, can only be rendered with the help of databases and script modules. However, the most commonly used free HTTP server solutions include:

  * [XAMPP][5]
  * [NGINX][6]
  * [Lighttpd][7]
  * [Caddy][8]
  * [Tomcat][9]

## XAMPP {#xampp-stands}

XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P), and Perl (P). It is a free and open-source web server software. It helps developers to test their web apps or websites in their development environment. XAMPP has all the necessary components including Apache, Perl as well as MySQL database, and PHP. It provides a reliable development environment for Perl and PHP based web applications. Moreover, It provides MariaDB and MySQL for database management. Here are some of its key features:

  * Open Source
  * Multiple Instances
  * Compatibility

## NGINX {#NGINX}

NGINX web server supports all the components of the modern Web including WebSocket, HTTP/2, and streaming of multiple video formats. It started out as a web server but now, it has developed to also function as a reverse proxy software for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP). It also works as a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers. Moreover, this reverse proxy software consistently beats Apache and other servers if measured on web server performance. Some important features of NGINX include:

  * Modular architecture
  * Load balancing and fault tolerance
  * IP-based geolocation
  * Name-based and IP-based virtual servers
  * Supports SSL and TLS SNI
