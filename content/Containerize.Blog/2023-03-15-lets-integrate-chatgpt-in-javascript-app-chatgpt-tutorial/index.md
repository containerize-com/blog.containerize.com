## Overview

Hello readers! Thank you so much for your overwhelming response to the blog posts that we published on [ChatGPT][1] integrations. We are here with another useful Chatgpt tutorial following your interest. In addition, we will be in a loop to publish articles beneficial to your academics and career. However, we have started a [series][20] of JavaScript tutorials so it is the best time to write a guide that demonstrates how to **integrate ChatGPT in JavaScript app** programmatically. Further, we will write the code snippet to make this GPT-3 based **viral chatbot** functionality. For this purpose, we will enable ChatGPT functionality in a Node.js app. Therefore, a basic level of prior knowledge of Node.js is a plus while going through this guide. 

The following sections will be covered in this ChatGPT tutorial:

  * **[Pre-requisites - ChatGPT JavaScript wrapper][2]**
  * **[ChatGPT integration with Node.js application][3]**

## Pre-requisites - ChatGPT JavaScript wrapper {#Pre-requisites---ChatGPT-JavaScript-wrapper-}

This section demonstrates the requirements needed to enable ChatGPT integration in a Node.js-based application. Requirements are straightforward and easy to install on your system. 

Following are the pre-requires to practice this ChatGPT JavaScript integration:

 * [Node.js][4](>= 18)
 * [npm][5](>=9)

Once the above prerequisites are installed, the next step is to get an OpenAI API key. This key is used to make API requests to the ChatGPT programmatically. Therefore, please visit [this][6] link to learn how to obtain the OpenAI API key in case you don't know the procedure. 
Please keep your API key in a safe place and that's all for the requirements phase.

## ChatGPT integration with Node.js application {#ChatGPT-integration-with-Node.js-application}

Now, we are all set to integrate ChatGPT in JavaScript app programmatically. First, open the terminal and run the following command:

```
npm i chatgpt
```
Upon successful run, follow the following steps and the code snippet to make a request to GPT-3 model to interact with ChatGPT programmatically:

 * Import the ChatGPTAPI
 * Initialize the constructor with your OpenAI API key
 * Invoke the sendMessage method to send a message to the GPT-3 model
 * Display the response

## JavaScript Closures {#JavaScript-Closures}

This is another important concept that strengthens your JavaScript knowledge about scopes and data encapsulation. In the simplest form, a function inside a function is known as a closure. You may call the inner function a closure. This inner function has three types of scope:

 * It has its own block-level scope.
 * It has access to parent's variables
 * Variables in the global scope are also accessible inside the closure

Copy and paste the above code snippet into your main server file and run the following command into your terminal:
```
node index.js
```
**NOTE**: Please add ("type": "module",) into your package.json file in case you get an error "Cannot use import statement outside a module".
You can see the output in the image below:

In addition, this ChatGPT JavaScript wrapper lets you track conversations and send follow-up messages. The only thing you need to do is to pass "parentMessageId" in the request body as shown in the code snippet below:
```
response = await api.sendMessage('How are you?', {
  parentMessageId: res.id
})
console.log(res.text);
```
Likewise, you can explore many other methods offered [here][7]. This OpenAI chatbot integration can give a competitive edge to your enterprise-level application.
## Conclusion

This point brings us to the end of this **ChatGPT tutorial**. We hope you have learned how to **integrate ChatGPT in JavaScript app** programmatically. Further, you have the working code snippet that you can test on your local machine. This blog post is an asset if you are thriving to learn ChatGPT integration in your Node.js application.
