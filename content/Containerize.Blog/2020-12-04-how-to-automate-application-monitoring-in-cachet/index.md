  * [Requirements][1]
  * [Setup Monitoring Plugin][2]
  * [Creating Linux Service][3]
  * [Conclusion][4]

## Requirements {#Requirements}

  * Install latest version of the Cachet.
  * Familiar with the Linux services.

## Setup Monitoring Plugin {#Plugin}

The following are steps to install and configure the plugin for monitoring on Ubuntu.

  * Download binary from [release page][5]. 
  * Rename the file to cachet-monitor.
  * Make the file executable with the command.


```
sudo chmod +x cachet-monitor
```


  * Put the executable in a PATH directory, so you can access it directly via terminal. So, I suggest you move under **/usr/local/bin**.
  * Create a config.json file by running the following command. 


```
sudo nano config.json
```


  * Copy the below code into it and save the file.


```
{
  "api": {
    "url": "https://demo.cachethq.io/api/v1",
    "token": "9yMHsdioQosnyVK4iCVR",
    "insecure": false
  },
  "date_format": "02/01/2006 15:04:05 MST",
  "monitors": [
    {
      "name": "google",
      "target": "https://google.com",
      "strict": true,
      "method": "POST",
      "component_id": 1,
      "metric_id": 4,
      "template": {
        "investigating": {
          "subject": "{{ .Monitor.Name }} - {{ .SystemName }}",
          "message": "{{ .Monitor.Name }} check **failed** (server time: {{ .now }})\n\n{{ .FailReason }}"
        },
        "fixed": {
          "subject": "I HAVE BEEN FIXED"
        }
      },
      "interval": 1,
      "timeout": 1,
      "threshold": 80,
      "expected_status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```


  * Now, test your configuration with this command.


```
cachet-monitor -c config.json
```


  * If everything works well, move to the next section and create a Linux service.

## Creating Linux Service {#Service}

The following are steps to create and start a Linux service to automate the monitoring process.

  * Create a service **cachet-monitor.service** file. 


```
sudo nano cachet-monitor.service
```


  * Copy the below code into it and save the file.


```
[Unit]
Description=Cachet Monitor
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/sbin
ExecStart=cachet-monitor -c /root/config.json
Restart=always
Environment=USER=root HOME=/root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


  * Update systemd configuration by running the command. 


```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```


  * Enable cachet-monitor service by running the command, so it can load on system startup. 


```
sudo systemctl enable cachet-monitor.service
```


## Conclusion {#Conclusion}

Cachet a is free and **open source status page** system. However, it does not provide out of the box feature for **web application monitoring**. Instead, it has a powerful Rest API that can be used to perform actions such as incidents, components, groups, and many more. In this article, we have used the third-party plugin to automate application monitoring in Cachet. Above all, you can develop your own plugin or use any other existing plugin to do the job.
