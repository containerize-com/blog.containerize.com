## Overview

In the near past, we published some blog posts on topics such as How To Leverage SSO System For Better Business Growth, and Top 5 Open Source Single Sign-On Software In the Year 2021. These articles describe widely used open source SSO software and its core impacts on business. However, user management is the most critical aspect of any application. In the modern world of technology, cybersecurity is a hot topic. There are tons of applications that users visit, log in, and log out. A user with multiple sets of credentials is more vulnerable and an easy target of cyberattacks. 

Therefore, it is always a good idea to access resources using a single set of credentials. Single sign-on software enables users to log in to multiple applications using a single username and password. Users will log in one time only and can access many applications without login in again. This approach is gaining popularity day by day as the open source community is developing open source identity providers such as [Identityserver4][1] and [Keycloak][2]. In this blog post, we will go through the top two open source SSO solutions and will compare the features and scopes as the title suggests Keycloak vs Identityserver4. The following points will be covered.

## Brief introduction of Identityserver4 {#intro}

[Identityserver4][1] is an open source SSO software based on OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. This free tool is written in the .NET framework (4.5.x) and .NET Core to provide single sign-on services across multiple applications. As an authentication server, it provides a JWT token that can be used to access digital resources. It offers many provisions such as access control for API, user interface customizations, API authorization, and claim-based provider. Further, it is flexible, extensible, and comes with self-hosting capabilities. In addition, it supports multiple flows and federated identities such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. 

All the source code of this free single sign-on software is available on [Github][7]. Therefore, users can go through all the documentation regarding deployment and development.

## What is Keycloak? {#key}

[Keycloak][2] is another widely used authentication solution. It offers identity and access management using OpenID Connect, OAuth2.0, and SAML 2.0. This free software provides a user-friendly UI to manage users, roles, configurations, and sessions. Moreover, it provides integrations with third-party applications such as LDAP and Active Directory. Users can leverage its centralized user management with enhanced scalability and availability. Above all, it provides client libraries for integrations along with many features such as social logins, user federation, centralized management, password policies, clustering, and adapters. All the source code of this free single sign on software is available on [Github][8]. Therefore, users can go through all the documentation regarding deployment and development.
