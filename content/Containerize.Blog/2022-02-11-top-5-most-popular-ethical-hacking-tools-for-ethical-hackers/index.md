## Overview

Ethical Hacking is performed to identify potential threats to a computer or network. it is also called penetration testing, intrusion testing, and red teaming.Hacking is the process of gaining access to a computer system with the intention of fraud, data stealing, and privacy invasion etc. by identifying its weaknesses. A person who performs the hacking activities is called a hacker.

A security professional who uses hacking skills for defensive purposes is called an ethical hacker. To strengthen security, ethical hackers use their skills to find vulnerabilities, document them, and suggest ways to rectify them. Companies that provide online services or those which are connected to the internet, must perform penetration testing by ethical hackers. Penetration testing is another name for ethical hacking. It can be performed manually or through an automation tool.

Ethical hackers work as information security experts. They try to break the security of a computer system, network, or application. They identify the weak points and based on that, they give advice or suggestions to strengthen the security. Programming languages that are used for hacking include PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby, Bash, Perl, C, C++, Java, VBScript, Visual Basic, C Sharp, JavaScript, and HTML.This article is about best open source ethical hacking tools used by hackers.
