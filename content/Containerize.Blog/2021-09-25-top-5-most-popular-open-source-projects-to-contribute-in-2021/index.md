## **Overview**

**Open source** refers to source code of a software that can be modified, accessed and shared by anyone. The intent is to make the applications freely distribute copies with the public. It’s easy to take most popular open source projects for granted. However, open source software rely on developers and tech professionals who donate their time and efforts to collaborate. Open source projects provide opportunities to make meaningful contributions to online communities. Plus, participating in this collaborative approach of development can improve your own skills and expertise.

You don’t need to be a software developer or professional to contribute to an open source software project. A project documentation and source code that develop an open source software have all been developed, tested, used, discussed and refined by members of the project team. **Open source project development and contribution** **processes** can be divided into different steps like requiring different skills, levels of involvement and degrees of technical expertise. So, if you want to contribute in most popular open source projects then there is a range of roles to choose from writing and updating documentation, new features, designing, testing, reporting or fixing reported bugs.

Businesses are constantly changing and searching for digital solutions to turn bigger profits faster. So, depending on the type of a software, you’ll need a qualified software developer to investigate the source code, customize the software to your specifications, and integrate it into your digital solutions. All of contributors help to keep a project software active and strengthen the project community to help them run more efficiently. The exact roles and mechanisms for participating will be decided by the **project’s business model** and may vary from project to project. The tools for communicating within the community and making contributions can also vary. Project mailing lists forums or other tools are the main communication channel. The project’s website or documentation should provide clear guidelines on how to get started and which channels to use.
