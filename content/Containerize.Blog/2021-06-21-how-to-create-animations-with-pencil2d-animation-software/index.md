## Overview of the Application Interface {#application-interface}

Before we start with the actual Pencil2D tutorial on how to create animations with Pencil2D here is a bit of overview of the user interface, and some good to know tools and features:

  * **White Board:** When you launch Pencil2D for the first time, you will see a main white board in the middle, surrounded by controls panels, tools and features where you will create the main portion of the animation
  * **Tools:** on the left side you will find the Tools feature that includes brush tool, pencil, eraser, bucket tool to add color, and all features that will allow you to sketch out a cartoon or animation and define it.
  * **Options Box:** below the tools box you have the ability to include or remove the options window where you get the option to define the attributes of the tools you’re using. For instance, if you’re using a brush you can toggle between thickness of the brush, how light or dark the color will appear and similar features.
  * **Display Box:** below the options window is the Display box where you can manipulate the sketch you’ve drawn on the white board, such as flipping it right or left, applying onion skin to previous sketches and more.
  * **Color Palette:** here you’ll find all the available colors that can be added to your drawings.
  * **Color Box:** right below the color palette is the color box that allows you to choose specific color shades from the color wheel.
  * **Timeline Panel:** this is one of the most important part of the Pencil2D which allows you to apply layers to your animation starting with the bitmap layer, vector layer, and camera layer. You can also add key frames to create a video animation, delete and duplicate frames, and more.

Once you’ve mastered and understood these tools, you can start creating animations and sketches immediately, or try and learn as you go.

Now, we can move onto creating a basic animation with Pencil2D.

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Lets start by creating a simple animation by selecting the <strong>Pencil </strong>from the Tools box and creating a circle to the white board. This white board also represents the first frame of our animation, which can be seen in the Timeline panel below.{{< figure align=center src="images/IMG-20210617-WA0049.jpg" alt="Create Animations With Pencil2D Animation Software">}}
  </li>
  <li>
    Now by clicking on the Keys icon in the Timeline panel we can add a new frame where we can draw another circle. With the help of keys you can add new frames or go back to the previous frames and edit the sketches made there.{{< figure align=center src="images/IMG-20210617-WA0050.jpg" alt="Create Animations With Pencil2D Animation Software">}}
  </li>
  <li>
    Our animation is currently being made on the bitmap layer, and the more frames we keep on adding, we can enhance the animation further. Once you’ve added as many frames as you want, you can click the play button, and see the flow. You can also replay or move through the frames.{{< figure align=center src="images/IMG-20210617-WA0051.jpg" alt="Create Animations With Pencil2D Animation Software">}}
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to save your animation go to file. Click on Export and you will find the option to save your animation as a Movie, Image Sequence, Animated Gif and more.{{< figure align=center src="images/IMG-20210617-WA0053.jpg" alt="Create Animations With Pencil2D Animation Software">}}
  </li>
  <li>
    While saving the animation you have the option to adjust the width and height, the frame rate, and if you want it to play in a loop or not. {{< figure align=center src="images/IMG-20210617-WA0048.jpg" alt="Create Animations With Pencil2D Animation Software">}}
  </li>
</ol>
