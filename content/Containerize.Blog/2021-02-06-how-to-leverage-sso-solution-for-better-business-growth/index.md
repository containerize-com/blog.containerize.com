## What is SSO technology? {#what}

[Single Sign-On][6] is an identification and **authentication software** that enables you to login using third-party sites. SSO software acts as an identity provider so that you can log in to multiple sites with a single set of usernames/passwords. However, it is a one-time login mechanism and the SSO system makes sure the authenticity of the users. 

Moreover, this system has been widely used on small and enterprise-level to manage user’s identities across multiple applications. There are many open-source Single Sign-On software available that use popular authorization protocols such as OpenID OpenID, SAML, and OAuth.

## **How Single Sign-on(SSO) works?** {#features}

The working mechanism of **open source Single Sign-On** is straight. The user enters credentials in the login form, the user will be moved on upon successful completion of SSO authentication. Now, whenever a user visits any site that is integrated with any SSO solution, the system will check either user is already logged in or not. Further, if the user is already logged in, the server will issue a tracker/token and this token/tracker will be used to make sure your authentication across multiple applications. Along with SSO capabilities, it also provides user management and security features as mentioned below.

  * Easy To Use
  * Federated Identity 
  * Seamlessness 
  * OAuth v2 Protocol
  * User Management
