## **Overview**

**What is open source technology?** Open source technology is a growing trend in geographic information system (GIS). Open-source software (OSS) is computer software in which the source code or the base code is available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights for re-usability. Further, this open source software presentation is not limited to software development tools and technology.

This article on **top emerging technologies** brings to you the open source trending technologies in 2022. New technologies are evolving that help address global challenges and those technologies will make life simpler in the coming years. This article will introduce you to all the popular and trending technologies in the market which you should adopt in 2022. These are the trending technologies that you need to learn in 2022 for a successful career. That’s why we’ve listed the best open source technologies to contribute in 2022. Let’s get started with popular technologies and have a look at the **top future technologies**.

  * Artificial Intelligence
  * DevOps
  * Internet Of Thing(IOT)
  * Cyber Security
  * Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
  * Cloud Computing and Services
  * Full Stack Development
  * Big Data and Analytics
  * Robotics
  * Blockchain
  * Conclusion

## 1. Artificial Intelligence

**What is Artificial intelligence?** Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by smart machines to perform intellectual tasks such as decision making, problem solving, perception and understanding human communication. It is a wide-ranging branch of computer science and also called heuristic programming, machine intelligence, or the simulation of cognitive behavior. AI is the ability of a machine or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done with natural intelligence of humans.

There are four primary **types of Artificial intelligence** or or AI-based systems: reactive, limited memory machines, theory of mind, and self-aware. **The father of artificial intelligence**, John McCarthy at Stanford, introduced the term “artificial intelligence” in 2006. Basically, it is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines or robots and has become very popular in today’s world.

## 2. DevOps

**What is DevOps?** DevOps is a combination of practices and tools with collaboration between software development (dev) and operations (ops). It automates production and deployment processes between software development and IT operations.DevOps is a software engineering methodology that aims to increase an organization ability to deliver services and work throughout the **software development life cycle** (SDLC) at high velocity. It improves products at a faster pace than organization using traditional development methods and infrastructure management process.

## 3. Internet Of Thing(IOT)

**What is IOT?** The Internet of things or IoT is a system of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies. IoT connects and exchanges data with the billions of computing devices mechanical and digital machines over the Internet or communications networks around the world. Open source is playing a important role in creating IoT platforms. In the simplest terms, the Internet of Things (IoT) is how the digitally connected world of physical devices works. The Internet of Things (IoT) examples are energy management systems, machine learning, automated transportations, urban security and environment monitoring.

## 4. Cyber Security

**What is Cyber Security?** Cyber security, computer security, or information technology security (IT security) is to protect computer systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks. It’s aim is to control and reduce the risk of cyber attacks by protecting against the unauthorised exploitation of systems and networks. August Kerckhoffs is the **father of cyber security** or computer security. Denial of service, malware, phishing and SQL injection are some types of Cyber Security Threats.

## 5. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality

**What is Augmented Reality?** Augmented reality or AR is an interactive experience where designers enhance parts of the real physical world with the use of digital visual elements and sounds.

**What is Virtual Reality?** virtual reality or VR is the use of computer generated modeling and simulation with scenes that appear to be real, making the person feel like they are immersed in their surroundings with an artificial 3-D visual or simulated environments. Non-immersive, semi-immersive, and fully-immersive are three types of virtual reality simulations.

**What is difference between AR and VR?** AR uses a real-world setting and it can be accessed with a smartphone. VR is completely virtual and it requires a headset device. AR enhances both the virtual and real world while VR only creates an environment that is fully virtual.

## 6. Cloud Computing and Services

**What is Cloud Computing?** Cloud computing is an application-based software infrastructure that stores data or programs on remote serves instead of hard drive, which can be accessed through the internet. It uses a software, middleware, to ensure seamless connection between computers and devices linked via cloud computing. Cloud computing was invented by Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider in the 1960. 

**What are the types of cloud computing?** Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are 3 main types of cloud computing services.

## 7. Full Stack Development

**What is Full Stack Development?** Full stack development refers to the development of both front end or client side as well as back end or server side portions of web applications. A full stack web developer is someone who is expert on both the front end, back end, database and debugging of a web application or website. Full Stack Developers requires to have skills in a wide variety of software coding, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their full stack job very well.

## 8. Big Data and Analytics

**What is big data analytics?** Big data analytics is the use of advanced analytic techniques for the analysis of large volumes of diverse data sets. It includes structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from different sources or businesses. It also helps organizations and businesses to store, process, analyze, extract meaningful insights such as different patterns, correlations and market trends from massive data volumes.

## 9. Robotics

**What is Robotics?** Robotics is a multidisciplinary field of engineering and computer science. It involves the conception, design, manufacture, operation, and use of robots. Robotic technology is used to collect data, movement, manipulation, mobility, learning, and intelligence to improve IOT services. The **goal of robotics** is to design, construction, and use of robots that can help and assist humans beings.

## 10. Blockchain

Finally at the end of **open source technology examples** list , we have blockchain technology. 

**What is Blockchain?** Blockchain is a decentralized, inherently distributed, and oftentimes public, digital ledger technology (DLT) used by bitcoin. It consists of continuously growing list of records called encrypted blocks that is used to record transactions. Blockchain blocks are linked and secured using cryptography algorithms, a time stamp and transaction data to form a chronological order. A blockchain uses open source transactional database for tracking transactions of digital currencies like Bitcoin. It is one of the modern technologies with a bright future and blockchain developers need to know concepts like cryptography, data structures, and networking.

Blockchain technology allows **peer-to-peer transactions** so that users can send funds directly to another person. A blockchain platform allows users and developers to create novel use of a blockchain infrastructure like Ethereum. The number of live blockchain platforms are increasing every day and there are more than 10,000 active cryptocurrencies based on blockchain in 2022.

## **Conclusion:** {#4a1a}

We have come to the end of our list of current and trending **top 10 emerging technologies** 2022. These top ten open source technologies have dramatically changed the world around us. This world would be a very different place without these open source platforms and technologies. There are some closed source alternatives available for these free technologies. FOSS4G and State of the Map events are opportunities to learn more about the needs of open source of software. Almost everything would be different without the evolving **oss open source software**. Thankful for the open source initiative and communities.
