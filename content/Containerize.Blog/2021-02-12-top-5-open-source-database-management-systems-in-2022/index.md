## Overview

Database Management systems offer a systematic approach for the management of databases via a user interface. Moreover, a Database Management system is a software package that provides essential technology solutions for manipulation, optimization as well as management and retrieving of data from the databases. Similarly, it also provides access to data for both online and offline applications. We will discuss the following top open source DBMS software in this article:

  * [MySQL][1]
  * [PostgreSQL][2]
  * [MariaDB][3]
  * [SQLite][4]
  * [MongoDB][5]

## MySQL {#mysql}

MySQL is a free and open-source database management system and provides support for cross-platforms. In fact, it allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to fit their specific environments and requirements. Most developers use MySQL DBMS with PHP, which is the most popular programming language for web applications. Good examples for PHP & MySQL-based web apps are WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. MySQL works with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc. However, all the source code of this open source DBMS is available on [Github][6] with documentation regarding development and deployment. 

Following are the prominent features:

  * Easy of use
  * Compatible to cross-platforms
  * Secure
  * Uses multi-layered server design with independent modules
  * Free to download
  * High performance

## PostgreSQL {#postgre}

PostgreSQL is the most advanced relational DBMS software because of its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set as well as extensibility, and disaster recovery. Just like other database management systems, it is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It extends the SQL language and adds many additional features. PostgreSQL is highly extensible. You can define your custom data types, build out custom functions, even write code from different programming languages without recompiling the database. Therefore, it is written in C language. However, all the source code of this open source DBMS is available on [Github][8] with documentation regarding development and deployment. 

PostgreSQL has the following key features:

  * Open Source
  * Online backup
  * Binary and textual large-object storage
  * Embedded SQL implementation using preprocessor
  * Per-column collation
  * Universally unique identifier

## MariaDB {#maria}

MariaDB can be used as a MySQL alternative. It is a relational DBMS software that provides reliability, data integrity, concurrency, consistency as well as disaster recovery, and extensibility for your web applications. It provides support for both small data processing tasks as well as for enterprise needs. MariaDB also supports relational, JSON, and hybrid data models along with transactional, analytical, and hybrid workloads. In addition, MariaDB is one of the most popular DBMS software. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions. Therefore, it is written in C and C++ languages. However, all the source code of this open source DBMS is available on [Github][10] with documentation regarding development and deployment. 

This relational DBMS offers the following important features:

  * JSON support
  * Open Source
  * Larger and Faster Connection Pool
  * Provides safer and faster replication
  * System versioned tables
  * ColumnStore storage engine / InfiniDB

## SQLite {#sqlite}

SQLite is lightweight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resources. It is a Library of C-language that acts as a database engine that is a small, fast, self-contained as well as highly reliable, and most used database engine in the world.  Further, the SQLite DB engine can be linked statically or dynamically as per the requirement of the application. SQLite is server-less as it does not require a separate server process or system to operate like other RDMBS. In addition, SQLite DBMS is available for different platforms like Windows (Win32, WinCE, WinRT) and also for UNIX (Linux, Mac OS-X, Android, iOS). Therefore, it is written in C language. However, all the source code of this DBMS software is available on [Github][12] with documentation regarding development and deployment. 

Just like other database management systems, the following are the prominent features of this open source DBMS:

  * Server-less Database engine
  * Self-contained
  * Requires zero configuration
  * A single cross-platform disk file store complete SQLite database
  * No external dependencies required
  * Available for different platforms

## MongoDB {#mongo}

MongoDB is also one of the top document-oriented databases. It provides fast access to data because of its nature of implementing internal memory to store the data. So, MongoDB can handle structured as well as unstructured data within various types of applications. MongoDB database is a secure and easy to scale database. Therefore, it can be used in supporting content management systems, e-commerce systems, mobile applications, data analytics section, archiving as well as online and offline gaming applications.  It can be easily set up and scalable. Data can be updated very quickly. However, all the source code of this document-oriented database is available on [Github][14] with documentation regarding development and deployment. 

This document-oriented database has the following key features:

  * High elastic Scalability
  * Replication facility to secure data
  * Rich collection of queries
  * Auto-sharding
  * Open-source
  * Handles structured and unstructured data
